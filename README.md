# HAMOYE DATA SCIENCE STAGE A QUIZ

This is the submission of my assessment quiz of the Hamoye Data Science Internship Stage A.

This quiz was an assessment of our understanding of the **Introduction to Python for Machine Learning Course.** The 60 minutes quiz had a section numbereed 11 to 20 where we imported, wrangled and answered some questions on the African Food Production Dataset which was provided by the FAO website.

This food Balance Sheet compiled by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations contains selection of African countries food country supply between 2014 to 2018.

This food balance sheet shows the food items for human consumption, along with how much was produced, used, imported/exported, and how it benefits the society (per capita supply).

The dataset can be obtained via this link [FoodBalanceSheets_E_Africa_NOFLAG.csv](https://github.com/HamoyeHQ/HDSC-Introduction-to-Python-for-machine-learning/files/7768140/FoodBalanceSheets_E_Africa_NOFLAG.csv)
